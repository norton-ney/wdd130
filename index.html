        <p> Alagoas is a small state in northeastern Brazil whose 
            tropical coastline is marked by white sand beaches
            lined with palm trees, crystal-clear lagoons and coral 
            reefs. In MaceiÃ³, its capital, the famous PajuÃ§ara and 
            Ponta Verde beaches are located, with hotels, bars and 
            restaurants. Coral reefs decorate the coast north of MaceiÃ³,
             which is why it is nicknamed Costa dos Corais<br> -Wikipedia
